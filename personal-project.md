# Personal Projects


## Objective
Demonstrate to potential employers that you understand a broad range of relevant topics and how they fit together. This is a requirement for graduation. Your end project should encompass, at a minimum, each one of these features.

## Result

Here’s a checklist of things that would be impressive to show people.  This could be one app, or several smaller apps.

### Required
* 2 commits per week *at least*
* Must write all CSS, no bootstrap or foundation or bourbon
* User authentication (this can be only an Admin side to put content in)
* 2-4 models that interrelate 
  * One many to many relationship
  * one belongs to relationship
* Something visually flashy - images, maps, a slick javascript widget etc…
* API integration that pulls data from another website / pushes data to other sites (like Twitter, Text messages etc…)
* An API that others can use to get your data
  * this can be in the form of an API for your JavaScript
* Email integration - probably using SendGrid via the Heroku addon - could be as simple as a forgot-password email
* All the things we do in class:
  * good commit messages
  * tests
  * really good readmes
* Something explaining what’s interesting about the project 
  * could be on a separate about page or on github pages
* A cool algorithm. 
  * This can be something like taking tweets and replacing certain words to make them funny, or a calculation that requires more than simple math.
* It looks decent on a mobile device 
* A realtime component - like an auto-updating page (like tracker has)
* Open-sourced under the Apache v2 License.
* Has decent CSS and structure

### Potential

* Re-write a sinatra app to a Rails app. 

## Process

I suggest starting with the interesting part of your app (Cameras, Wine etc…) and adding authentication later if that’s an option.

Make a goal to ship twice a week - so two significant deploys to Heroku per week. This will start around week 4-5.

Test drive everything - even the hard parts.  Expect employers to check your github repositories.  This is a selling point.
