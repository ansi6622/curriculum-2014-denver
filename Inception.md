# Student Anti-Goals
### Produce XP religious followers - absolutely fight against this

### Know everything!

### Security

# Instructor/Program Goals
### Support everyone

### Be fair to everyone, no special treatment - everyone is equal regardless of skill/race/background

### Move to writing software 8 hours a day ASAP - quickly move away from lectures

### Code review pomodoros - both student and instructor

### Everyone get’s a job (success) - everyone get’s access to same support and resources to find a job

### Every student knows what to focus on and what not to focus on

### De-mystify the whole practice of software engineering and how computers work

### Pushing students into their discomfort zone

### Constant feedback loop that informs students/instructors of exactly where they are

### Class grows/changes as needed
* We don’t know all of the answers

### Instructors can admit failure on goals
* Failures, discomfort is when we all learn
* Open and honest

### Students have trust in our instruction


### Missing a few days is not a big deal

### A record of what happened when, and what went well/didn’t
* What exercises worked, what didn’t
* Warmups organized
* Enhance students to support class
* trello?
* enhance instructor manual to make next class better
* organization!

### A plan for the next ~1-2 weeks that’s visible and verbalized
* rough, not set in stone
* what we changed and why

### Move everything to github
* manuals
* books
* tutorials

# Instructor/Program Anti-Goals
### A re-usable set of videos that could be used by a larger audience

### A re-usable set of videos that students use as supplemental material

### Make everyone comfortable
* things that you think are good for you, may not be

### 100% student graduation

### Pushing someone into their panic zone

### Custom tailored curriculum for a single student

### Ranking students

### Grading students

### Encourage out of class time or missing class during class hours

### Solidified curriculum for all 24 weeks that can’t change.

# Expectations
### Everyone participates in Retros

### These are important, even if you don’t “get it” immediately

### Every warmup becomes homework if not finished in time.

### Everyone is proficient in ALL warmups - measurable.

### Everyone shows up at 9 leaves at 5.

### 20% time is

### Missing class is only for sickness/personal emergencies. No vacation.
* Remember, it’s only 6 months and we have a lot to cover.
* One week is equivalent to a full college semester (MWF 1 hr lectures a week).
