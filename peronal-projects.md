# Personal Projects


## Objective
Demonstrate to potential employers that you understand a broad range of relevant topics and how they fit together. This is a requirement for graduation. Your end project should encompass, at a minimum, each one of these features.

## Result

Here’s a checklist of things that would be impressive to show people.  This could be one app, or several smaller apps.

### Required
* User authentication (either database authentication like we did with Sinatra, or OAuth (login with Google, Facebook etc…)
* 2-4 models that interrelate 
* Something visually flashy - images, maps, a slick javascript widget etc…
* API integration that pulls data from another website / pushes data to other sites (like Twitter, Text messages etc…)
* An API that others can use to get your data
* Email integration - probably using SendGrid via the Heroku addon - could be as simple as a forgot-password email
* All the things we do in class:
  * good commit messages
  * tests
  * really good readmes
* Something explaining what’s interesting about the project - could be on a separate about page or on github pages
* A cool algorithm. This can be something like taking tweets and replacing certain words to make them funny, or a calculation that requires more than simple math.
* It looks decent on a mobile device (I can help you get the iPhone simulator installed on your machines)
* A realtime component - like an auto-updating page (like tracker has)
* Open-sourced under the Apache v2 License.

### Potential

* Re-write a sinatra app to a Rails app. 

## Process

I suggest starting with the interesting part of your app (Cameras, Wine etc…) and adding authentication later if that’s an option.

Make a goal to ship twice a week - so two significant deploys to Heroku per week. This will start around week 4.

Test drive everything - even the hard parts.  Expect employers to check your github repositories.  This is a selling point.

## CSS

If you choose a framework like Twitter Bootstrap, please spend some time customizing it so it doesn’t look like the thousands and thousands of other sites that are also on Twitter Bootstrap.

If you write your own CSS, be sure to highlight that in your about page, because it’s a plus.
