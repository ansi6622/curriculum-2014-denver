# Expectations
### Everyone participates in Retros
* These are important, even if you don’t “get it” immediately
* It's how we course correct.
* At least one question per person, no opting out.

### Every warmup becomes homework if not finished in time.
* Warmups are KEY to success, do them!
* Should be comfortable with all warmups by graduation
* These are very similar to interview problems
