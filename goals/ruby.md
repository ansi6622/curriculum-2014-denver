You should be able to write a short Ruby code snippet for each of the following. You can use IRB to make sure that you have valid Ruby code:

* Syntax - constants, variables, methods
* Enumerable and Hashes
* Data Structures
  * Arrays
  * Hashes
  * Complex Hashes (deep nesting)
  * params
  * ActiveRecord collections
* Understanding of return values and their types
  * explicit vs implicit return
* Understanding of input values (parameters) and their types
* Control flow, if/else/while
* Classes vs. Objects vs. Constants
* Inheritance
* Modules/Mixins
* Gem/Libraries vs. Ruby core vs. Rails
* Understand blocks and their uses
  * Can implement a method that yields a block
* Can refactor code
  * Complex `if`'s to Classes
  * Keep logic out of controllers
