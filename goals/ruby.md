You should be able to write a short Ruby code snippet for each of the following. You can use IRB to make sure that you have valid Ruby code:

* Syntax - constants, variables, methods
* Enumerable and Hashes
* Simple Data Structures - Arrays, Hashes, Complex Hashes (deep nesting), params, ActiveRecord collections
* Understanding of return values and their types, explicit vs implicit return
* Understanding of input values (parameters) and their types
* Control flow, if/else/while
* Classes vs. Objects vs. Constants
* Inheritance
* Modules/Mixins
* Gem/Libraries vs. Ruby core vs. Rails
* a comment
* a local variable named "fights_crime" whose value is true
* a string with the value "hello"
* a string (with any value) and call the "upcase" method on that string
* a string with an interpolated value ("holding spots in a string")
* a constant named "foo" with the value "bar"
* a while loop that ends when a variable named "count" is greater than 10 and prints counts to the screen
* a symbol named "book"
* a local variable called "count" whose value is an integer
* an instance variable named "wheels" with the value "4"

* an empty array
* an array with the following values: "a", "b", "c", "d"
* a local variable called "countries" with the values "US", "Canada" and "Mexico"
* an instance variable named "third" whoâ€™s value is the 3rd of the countries array from above
* iterate over the countries array, and print each item to the screen

* an empty hash
* a local variable named symbol_superheroes that is a hash with the following keys / values:  :name is "batman", :real_name is "bruce wayne" (keys are symbols)
* the value of the :name key of the symbol_superheroes hash
* a local variable named string_superheroes that is a hash with the following keys / values:  "name" is "batman", "real_name" is "bruce wayne" (keys are strings)
* the value of the "name" key of the string_superheroes hash

* a conditional statement that checks if "a" is equal to "b" and prints "yay!" if it is, and "boo!" if it's not
* a case statement to check a local variable named "status" with checks for: "active", "pending"

* a class named "Bike"
* a module named "Shed"
* a multiline comment (w/ begin / end)
* a local variable named "sum" that holds the value of 1 + 2
* a class named "User" inside a module named "Authentication"
* a class named "Watch" that includes a module named "Wearable"
* a class named "Garden" with an initializer that takes an argument called "plots"

* a method named "walk" (that takes no arguments)
* a method named "walk" which takes an argument called "speed" and an optional argument "direction" that defaults to "north"
* call a method named foo and pass it a block

* an empty proc
* a proc that takes two arguments, "x" and "y"
* a lambda that takes two arguments "a" and "b"
* a stabby lambda that takes two arguments "x" and "y"
* a regular expression that looks for the word cat anywhere
