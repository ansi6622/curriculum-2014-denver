* Comfortable giving demos

### Students don’t need instructors - you can succeed independently
* Know how to research effectively
* Still can make progress when solo

# Student Anti-Goals
### Dogmatic developers - absolutely fight against this
* There is no right way to do things
* Ruby/Rails is a tool in your toolbelt, not the silver bullet
* There is no "right" process - although some are most likely better than others
* Being open to opinions

### Know everything!
* You'll never know everything
* Be okay with the unknown

### Security
* This ia whole domain that could take 6 months to teach, let's not distract from learning how to code

# Instructor/Program Goals
### Support everyone
* People learn differently, and that is embraced
* Encourage the community to help, other students to help, provide enough resources to succeed

### Be fair to everyone, no special treatment
* Everyone is equal, regardless of skill/race/background
* Everyone is equal, regardless of their graduation prospects

### Move to writing software 8 hours a day ASAP - quickly move away from lectures
* Real software is how you solidify concepts
* Lectures are a good foundation, but hands on is key

### Code review pomodoros - both student and instructor
* Students should be comfortable reading and writing code in front of a class
* Instill compentent conversations about code

### Everyone get’s a job (success)
* Everyone get’s access to same support and resources to find a job
* Graduation is just a guarantee, doesn't mean you aren't just as important

### Every student knows what to focus on and what not to focus on
* Students may need to prioritize their learning

### De-mystify the whole practice of software engineering and how computers work
* Computers are stupid and simple. Let's build that knowledge

### Pushing students into their discomfort zone
* This is where learning happens
* We thrive in discomfort

### Constant feedback loop that informs students/instructors of exactly where they are
* No one should be in the dark.

### Class grows/changes as needed
* We don’t know all of the answers

### Instructors can admit failure on goals
* Failures, discomfort is when we all learn
* Open and honest

### Students have trust in our instruction
* We are the authorities

### A record of what happened when, and what went well/didn’t
* What exercises worked, what didn’t
* Warmups organized
* Enhance students to support class
* trello?
* enhance instructor manual to make next class better
* organization!

### A plan for the next ~1-2 weeks that’s visible and verbalized
* rough, not set in stone
* what we changed and why

### Move everything to github
* manuals
* books
* tutorials

# Instructor/Program Anti-Goals
### A re-usable set of videos
* We don't care about the larger audience
* Students use videos as a crutch, it's better to write code
  * We'll release videos as we see fit

### Make everyone comfortable
* Things that you think are good for you, may not be
* You don't learn when you're comfortable!

### 100% student graduation
* Reality is that not everyone will graduate
  * It's okay, everyone's still gotten a job, and that's our goal

### Custom tailored curriculum for a single student
* We can't focus on one student, it's not fair to everyone
  * Encourage self learning with outside resources
* We provide the framework not the prescription for success

### Ranking students
* We don't grade
* We don't rank
* Everyone is good in different settings, need to find yours!

### Encourage out of class time or missing class during class hours
* This is your job. Be here.
* Everyone shows up at 9 leaves at 5.
  * Even on 20% days
* We have an office that we're expected to be in
* Execessive absence is grounds for non-graduation
  * Missing class is only for sickness/personal emergencies. No vacation.
  * Remember, it’s only 6 months and we have a lot to cover.
  * One week is equivalent to a full college semester (MWF 1 hr lectures a week).
  * 5 days??

### Solidified curriculum for all 24 weeks that can’t change.
* We will solicit feedback at every opportunity.
* This class lives and breath and we'll adjust as we need to. If it's not working, change it.
